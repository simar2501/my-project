Experiment: Interactive SVG Drawing Tool with Mouse Event Handlers

Objective:
- To design and build a web-based drawing tool using SVG where users can draw shapes interactively with their mouse.
- To understand JavaScript DOM manipulation, SVG element creation, and event handling.

Steps:
1. Create an HTML file with an SVG area that acts as the drawing canvas.
2. Style the SVG canvas using CSS (border, background color, and cursor style).
3. Write JavaScript to handle mouse events:
   - mousedown: start drawing and create a new SVG <path> element.
   - mousemove: update the path dynamically as the mouse moves.
   - mouseup: finish drawing the shape.
4. Append each drawn path to the SVG so that multiple shapes can be drawn without losing previous ones.
5. Test the drawing tool by writing text or shapes inside the canvas.

Expected Output:
- A web page with a rectangular SVG drawing area.
- Users can click and drag the mouse to draw freehand shapes and letters (similar to the example: drawing "ByteXL").
