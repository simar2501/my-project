Dynamic Product Filter with Dropdown using JavaScript DOM Manipulation

Objective:
- To build a web-based product list that can dynamically filter and display items based on the user's selection from a dropdown menu.
- To practice using JavaScript for DOM manipulation, handling user events, and updating visible elements in real time.

Task Description:
- Create a web page that displays a list of products (e.g., T-shirts, jeans, headphones, smartphones, novels, cookbooks).
- Provide a dropdown menu above the product list with filtering options such as "All", "Clothing", "Electronics", and "Books".
- When a user selects a category from the dropdown, only products matching that category should be displayed.
- If "All" is selected, the entire product list should be visible.
- Filtering should happen dynamically using JavaScript without reloading the page.

Implementation Details:
1. HTML Structure
   - A container is created to hold the product list and dropdown menu.
   - Each product is represented by a `div` element with a `data-category` attribute for filtering.

2. CSS Styling
   - Styled the container with borders, padding, and spacing.
   - Each product is displayed with a light background, border, and rounded corners for better readability.
   - Dropdown menu styled for usability.

3. JavaScript Functionality
   - Captured the dropdown selection event using `addEventListener`.
   - Loop through all products and check their `data-category` attribute.
   - Show or hide each product depending on whether it matches the selected category.
   - Ensures real-time filtering without reloading the page.

Learning Outcomes:
- Understanding of DOM manipulation using JavaScript.
- Handling user input events such as dropdown selection.
- Practical knowledge of dynamically updating webpage content.
- Improved ability to structure projects by separating HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files.

Conclusion:
This experiment demonstrates how JavaScript can be used to create dynamic and interactive web pages by filtering and updating product lists in real time based on user input.
