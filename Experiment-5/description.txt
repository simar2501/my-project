Experiment – Dynamic Product Filter

I created a Dynamic Product Filter using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It allows users to filter products by category from a dropdown menu.

1) HTML Structure

Container (<div class="container">): Holds the entire product filter interface.

Heading (<h2>): Displays the title “Product List”.

Label & Dropdown (<label> + <select id="category">):

Dropdown menu provides filter options: All, Clothing, Electronics, Books.

Product List (<div id="product-list">): Contains all product items.

Each product (<div class="product">) has a data-category attribute (e.g., Clothing, Electronics, Books).

Tags Used: <!DOCTYPE html>, <html>, <head>, <meta>, <title>, <style>, <body>, <div>, <h2>, <label>, <select>, <option>, <script>.

2) CSS Layout & Styling

Body: Uses Arial font with padding around the page.

Container:

Bordered box with padding, rounded corners, and fixed max width (400px).

Heading (h2): Small margin for spacing.

Dropdown (select): Full-width, padded, with margin below for spacing.

Product Boxes (.product):

Light gray border, padding, margin between items, and rounded edges for neat look.

3) JavaScript Functionality

Element Selection:

dropdown → selects the <select> element.

products → selects all product <div>s with the class .product.

Event Listener:

Listens for the "change" event on the dropdown menu.

Logic:

Gets the selected category (this.value).

Loops through all products using forEach.

If “All” is selected → every product is shown.

Otherwise → only products with matching data-category remain visible; others are hidden using style.display = "none".

4) Procedure

Created the HTML layout with a container, heading, dropdown filter, and product list.

Styled the layout with CSS (borders, padding, rounded corners, and spacing).

Wrote JavaScript to:

Detect dropdown selection.

Show or hide products dynamically based on category.

Tested the project locally to verify filtering works correctly.

5) Test Cases

Initial Load → All products are visible.

Select Clothing → Only “T-Shirt” and “Jeans” remain.

Select Electronics → Only “Headphones” and “Smartphone” remain.

Select Books → Only “Novel” and “Cookbook” remain.

Select All → All six products become visible again.

Switch rapidly between categories → Filtering updates instantly.

6) Key Learning Points

HTML data- attributes to categorize elements for filtering.

CSS basics for creating clean, structured layouts.

JavaScript DOM selection with getElementById and querySelectorAll.

Event-driven programming using addEventListener("change").

Dynamic element styling with style.display to show/hide items.

7) Learning Outcomes

Build a functional product filter with dropdown selection.

Use HTML attributes (data-category) to classify and manage items.

Write JavaScript logic to dynamically change the UI without reloading the page.

Strengthen understanding of DOM manipulation and event handling.

Apply combined HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for an interactive mini-project.
