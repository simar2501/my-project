Experiment - 5
Title: Dynamic Product Filter using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript

Description:

In this experiment, a simple web page is created that allows the user to filter products dynamically based on categories such as Clothing, Electronics, and Books. The implementation makes use of HTML for structure, CSS for styling, and JavaScript for interactivity.

1. HTML Structure:
   - The web page starts with a container <div> that holds all the content.
   - A heading ("Product List") is displayed at the top.
   - A dropdown menu (<select>) is provided for the user to choose a category. The options available are:
        - All
        - Clothing
        - Electronics
        - Books
   - Below the dropdown, there is a product list where each product is represented as a <div> with a class "product".
   - Each product also has a "data-category" attribute that defines its category. For example:
        - T-Shirt → Clothing
        - Smartphone → Electronics
        - Novel → Books

2. CSS Styling:
   - The overall body uses the Arial font and has some padding for spacing.
   - The container has a border, padding, rounded corners, and a fixed width for a neat look.
   - The dropdown (<select>) has padding and width set to 100% for better usability.
   - Each product item has a light gray border, some margin, padding, and slightly rounded corners to make them look like cards.

3. JavaScript Functionality:
   - JavaScript is used to make the product filtering work dynamically.
   - First, the dropdown element is selected using document.getElementById("category").
   - All products are selected using document.querySelectorAll(".product").
   - An event listener is added to the dropdown for the "change" event.
   - When the user selects a category:
        * If "All" is selected, all products are displayed.
        * Otherwise, only the products whose data-category matches the selected category remain visible.
        * Other products are hidden by changing their CSS display property to "none".

Conclusion:
This experiment demonstrates how HTML, CSS, and JavaScript can be combined to build a simple but interactive web page. It helps in understanding how to manipulate the DOM using JavaScript, apply styling with CSS, and organize content with HTML. The real-time filtering feature improves user experience and shows the practical use of event handling in JavaScript.
