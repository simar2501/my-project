1. Importing modules:
require('express') ->imports the Express framework.
const app = express(); ->creates an Express application.
const port = 3000; -> initializes the port number to 3000 where our server will run.
Sets up the basic Express Application

2.Middleware
express.json() is a Middleware which allows the server to read the JSOn data sent.
Any types of POST or PUT request is automatically parsed using this middleware.

3. Array of card objects:
Creates an array of card objects which is stores in memory.
Each card has id, suit(Hearts, Spades, etc.) and value(Ace, King, Jack, queen, etc.).
This creates a sample data on which our API works.

4. GET task:
Return all the cards stored in memory.
res.json(cards)->Sends the card array as JSON response.
We can find any card by its mentioned id and if it is not found an error message will be shown.

5. POST task:
Adds new card to the cards array.
creates new object with unique ID.
Checks if both the fields suit and value are provided or not.

6.DELETE task:
Deletes existing cards by its ID.
Finds indec of the card in the cards array.
If found-> removes the card and if not-> sends error message.

7. Start server:
At the end we need to start our Express surver on the specified port. 
It also logs a message on console showing the URl where the server is running.

8. Postman Tool:
Postman is a tool used to test APIs. It allows user send requests to the server and see the responses without writing a separate frontend.
It allows various tasks such as GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, etc.
Helps in cheking whether the API works correctly or not.

9. LEARNING OUTCOMES
Learnt how to create a REST API using node.js.
Understood how to use GET, POST, and DELETE routes for data operations.
Learnt how to handle JSON input with express.json() middleware.
Learnt how to send proper responses and handle errors (like 404 or 400).
Practiced starting a server on specified ports.
Practiced starting a server and testing API endpoints using Postman.
